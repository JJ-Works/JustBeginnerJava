/*Race condition is when multiple thread tries to reach out for the same data, or data of a variable.
* To solve this we can use synchronised keyword to synchronise threads meaning only one thread can access the data at once.
*
* Let me explain what happens:
* > main method runs
* > executes thread obj.run
* > main thinks it executed everything and runs along
* > if printed at last it may not have finished every processes.
* > the currently running thread tries to reach for the variable at the same time sometimes collision of data recovery happens
* > lets say count var has 4 value and unfortunately two thread reached at once then both updates the var with 5 if ++ is done
* > then even if the one thread incremented the value the other thread just resets to 4.
